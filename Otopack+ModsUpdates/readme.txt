# Otopack

This is a mix of CDDA-Soundpack and @'s soundpack with some additions, replacements and fixes. Covers all vanilla terrain, furniture and weapon sounds in CDDA-0.E. Does not cover any new terrain, furniture and weapon sounds added by any mods. Due to bugs or poor implementation, some sounds have been skipped (ice cream truck chimes, additional walking sounds, vehicle sounds for bicycles and boats). Some sounds were not added due to not being able to find any good sounds for them (vehicle reaper|scoop|scoop_thump, musical_instrument_bad). There are some sounds that don't seem to work but are included anyhow, like fire ignite. Finally, there's no way to setup gender based shouts, so if your female character yells like a man when using the yell command, don't blame me (or replace shout_default.ogg in Otopack\effects\shout\ with a female version).

To install, put the Otopack folder containing this readme in <CDDA Folder>\data\sound\ and then select it from the settings menu.
If you're a mobile player and your device is low on RAM, you might not be able to use this soundpack.

Music playlist contains a lot of great music provided by CuddleBaby - TheGoGoat from cdda discord
servers.

The music has been selected to complement the overall ambient tone, with some of them being slightly different for variety without straying too far. Some of the music has been edited to remove parts that stood out too much. If you want to replace the music and use your own, you can replace the bg .ogg files in the music folder. If you use copyright striking video services or want to disable the music, then simply delete the music folder to get rid of the background music. You can use another soundpack's music by using its musicset.json and music folder.
